I am an assistant professor in the finance division at Columbia Business School. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University in 2022, and hold an MA and BA from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 

My research lies in the intersection of macroeconomics, housing, and finance. I am particularly interested in the housing insecurity problem in the US rental market, where millions of renters are evicted every year and where homelessness is pervasive. My recent work examines how instating stronger tenant protections against evictions impacts rents, homelessness, and evictions.
